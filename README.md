# PacMan
-Faculty Project-
Course: Advanced Programming Methods 

Implementation of a simple version of PacMan Game. I call it simple, because there are only two entities (no food to be eaten): the protagonist and the ghosts, where the ghosts move randomly. The only purpose of the game is to run and not to be caught by ghosts.
Bonus: the number of ghosts and their speed can be adapted.
